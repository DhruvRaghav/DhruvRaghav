## 🚀 About Me

I’m a data scientist with over 6 years of experience across geospatial intelligence, healthcare analytics, and applied machine learning.  
I thrive at the intersection of data and decision-making, passionate about building scalable AI solutions that solve real-world problems.

My core focus areas include large language models (LLMs), computer vision, and full-cycle machine learning systems. I’ve led projects ranging from smart city segmentation and real-time emotion detection to generative AI tools using LLaMA, RAG, and Hugging Face Transformers.
